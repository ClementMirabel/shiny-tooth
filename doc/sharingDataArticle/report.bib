  abstract = {Clinical Data Management (CDM) is a critical phase in clinical research, which leads to generation of high-quality, reliable, and statistically sound data from clinical trials. This helps to produce a drastic reduction in time from drug development to marketing. Team members of CDM are actively involved in all stages of clinical trial right from inception to completion. They should have adequate process knowledge that helps maintain the quality standards of CDM processes. Various procedures in CDM including Case Report Form (CRF) designing, CRF annotation, database designing, data-entry, data validation, discrepancy management, medical coding, data extraction, and database locking are assessed for quality at regular intervals during a trial. In the present scenario, there is an increased demand to improve the CDM standards to meet the regulatory requirements and stay ahead of the competition by means of faster commercialization of product. With the implementation of regulatory compliant data management tools, CDM team can meet these demands. Additionally, it is becoming mandatory for companies to submit the data electronically. CDM professionals should meet appropriate expectations and set standards for data quality and also have a drive to adapt to the rapidly changing technology. This article highlights the processes involved and provides the reader an overview of the tools and standards adopted as well as the roles and responsibilities in CDM.},

    abstract = { Picture archiving and communication systems traditionally have depended on schema-based Structured Query Language (SQL) databases for imaging data management. To optimize database size and performance, many such systems store a reduced set of Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) metadata, discarding informational content that might be needed in the future. As an alternative to traditional database systems, document-based key-value stores recently have gained popularity. These systems store documents containing key-value pairs that facilitate data searches without predefined schemas. Document-based key-value stores are especially suited to archive DICOM objects because DICOM metadata are highly heterogeneous collections of tag-value pairs conveying specific information about imaging modalities, acquisition protocols, and vendor-supported postprocessing options. The authors used an open-source document-based database management system (Apache CouchDB) to create and test two such databases; CouchDB was selected for its overall ease of use, capability for managing attachments, and reliance on HTTP and Representational State Transfer standards for accessing and retrieving data. A large database was created first in which the DICOM metadata from 5880 anonymized magnetic resonance imaging studies (1,949,753 images) were loaded by using a Ruby script. To provide the usual DICOM query functionality, several predefined “views” (standard queries) were created by using JavaScript. For performance comparison, the same queries were executed in both the CouchDB database and a SQL-based DICOM archive. The capabilities of CouchDB for attachment management and database replication were separately assessed in tests of a similar, smaller database. Results showed that CouchDB allowed efficient storage and interrogation of all DICOM objects; with the use of information retrieval algorithms such as map-reduce, all the DICOM metadata stored in the large database were searchable with only a minimal increase in retrieval time over that with the traditional database management system. Results also indicated possible uses for document-based databases in data mining applications such as dose monitoring, quality assurance, and protocol optimization.© RSNA, 2012 }

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Knowledge in the era of Omics and Big Data has been increasingly conceptualized as a public good. Sharing of de-identified patient data has been advocated as a means to increase confidence and public trust in the results of clinical trials. On the other hand, research has shown that the current research  and development model of the biopharmaceutical industry has reached its innovation capacity. In response to that, the biopharmaceutical industry has adopted open innovation practices, with sharing of clinical trial data being among the most interesting ones. However, due to the free rider problem, clinical trial data sharing among biopharmaceutical companies could undermine their innovativeness. METHOD: Based on the theory of public goods, we have developed a  commons arrangement and devised a model, which enables secure and fair clinical trial data sharing over a Virtual Knowledge Bank based on a web platform. Our model uses data as a virtual currency and treats knowledge as a club good. RESULTS: Fair sharing of clinical trial data over the Virtual Knowledge Bank has  positive effects on the innovation capacity of the biopharmaceutical industry without compromising the intellectual rights, proprietary interests and competitiveness of the latter. CONCLUSION: The Virtual Knowledge Bank is a sustainable and self-expanding model for secure and fair clinical trial data sharing that allows for sharing of clinical trial data, while at the same time it increases the innovation capacity of the biopharmaceutical industry.},
